# DateAndTime
The project displays the current date and time in a specific format.
link of the site ----> https://raksha27yadav.github.io/DateAndTime/dateandtime.html
made this using HTML,CSS and Javascript.
I've used Date concept in javascript to achieve this and then got date,month,year,day,hour,min,seconds through its functions and then finally enclosed it in setInterval to give the live effect by setting it to 1000ms.
